# My portfolio website

### What?
- Design and develop my personal website to showcase my recent projects, present myself and provide contact details.
- Publish on `gh-pages` but also on personal domain.

### How?
Front-end project using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JS.  
##### Design decisions
  + Mobile-first approach
  + Single page with vertical scrolling
  + Font selection: `Arvo` for headings and `Proxima Nova` for main body text
  + Color scheme: black and white, grayscale and orange hues `#ff4422` or `rgb(255,68,34)`, `#fd8a58` or `rgb(253,138,88)`
  + Navigation menu: About | My work | Contact (order to be confirmed)
  + Menu fixed on top, white transparent background, no hamburger icon
  + Logo animation in navigation menu on first-time loading

### When?
- Build prototype in a week.
- Get feedback in the following week and refine.
- Deploy on personal domain in third week.
